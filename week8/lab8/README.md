<h2>Design a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to let users answer trivia questions.</h2>

<p><h4>1. In index.html, add beneath “Part 1” a multiple-choice trivia question of your choosing with HTML.</h4>
  - You should use an h3 heading for the text of your question.<br>
  - You should have one button for each of the possible answer choices. There should be at least three answer choices, of which exactly one should be correct.<br>
  - Using JavaScript, add logic so that the buttons change colors when a user clicks on them.<br>
  - If a user clicks on a button with an incorrect answer, the button should turn red and text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”.<br>
  - If a user clicks on a button with the correct answer, the button should turn green and text should appear beneath the question that says “Correct!”.<br>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><h4>2. In index.html, add beneath “Part 2” a text-based free response question of your choosing with HTML.</h4>
  - You should use an h3 heading for the text of your question.<br>
  - You should use an input field to let the user type a response.<br>
  - You should use a button to let the user confirm their answer.<br>
  - Using JavaScript, add logic so that the text field changes color when a user confirms their answer.<br>
  - If the user types an incorrect answer and presses the confirmation button, the text field should turn red and text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”.<br>
  - If the user types the correct answer and presses the confirmation button, the input field should turn green and text should appear beneath the question that says “Correct!”.<br>
