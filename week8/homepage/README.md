<h2>Design a homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h2>

<p><h4>Contain at least four different .html pages, at least one of which is index.html (the main page of your website), <br>
and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags</h4>></p>

<p><h4>Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site.</h4>
Bootstrap is a popular library (that comes with lots of CSS classes and more) via which you can beautify your site. <br>
See Bootstrap’s documentation to get started. In particular, you might find some of Bootstrap’s components of interest.</p>

<p><h4>Have at least one stylesheet file of your own creation, styles.css, which uses at least five (5) different CSS selectors</h4></p>

<p><h4>Integrate one or more features of JavaScript into your site to make your site more interactive.<br></h4></p>
